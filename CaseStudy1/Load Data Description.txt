The load data are obtained from ENTSOE-E [1] for France, Germany, and Switzerland, for the year 2013.
We assign the French profile to buses 1-39, the German profile to buses 40-78, and the Swiss
profile to bus 79-118.


The file "HourlyTimeVector2013.mat" include the time stamps for the simulation, in a convenient format.

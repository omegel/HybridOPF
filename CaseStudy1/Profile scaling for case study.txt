For each bus, we scale the load profile as follow:

1) We normalize the yearly country consumption profile so that the mean of the yearly
profile equals 1 [MW].
2) We multiply this normalized profile by the bus consumption given in the 
IEEE 118 bus test system. 
3) We multiply the resulting profile by 1.2. 

Note that "AverageLoadData"  in "CaseStudy1Parameters.m" corresponds to 120% of the 
IEEE test system values.

The PV plants are located at PV bus indicated in "CaseStudy1Parameters.m":
8, 30, 49, 77, 92, 100.
These PV plants receive the PV profiles from the following PV profile locations
(i.e. the index of the first dimension of "ACPowerOutput.mat" and "ACPowerEnsembleForecast2013.mat"):
4, 4, 6, 6, 3, 3.

For each PV plant we normalize the PV output and forecast (using the same coefficient for both output
and forecast, but different coefficients for different stations), so that the maximum PV output 
is equal to 1 MW.
Then, we scale these normalize profiles so that the maximum output values (for the time period 
considered) are equal to: 
2897, 4759, 4133, 4133, 2112, 2745.

This scaling corresponds to a PV penetration of 44% (for the July-August period considered),
and the location and size of each PV plant has been fine-tuned to prevent too large grid congestion.
